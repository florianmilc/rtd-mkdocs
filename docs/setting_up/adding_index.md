# Adding Content Files

You can use Markdown files to fill your website with content.
All Markdown files can be stored in one directory, for instance `docs/`.
You can use any text editor to create a Markdown file, but ensure the file extension is `.md`.

**Procedure:**

1. In the `docs/` directory, create an `index.md` file.
2. Edit the file and paste the following contents:
``` markdown title="index.md"
# Welcome

This is my first documentation website.
```
