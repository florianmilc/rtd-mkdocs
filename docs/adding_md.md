# Adding Content Files

You can use Markdown files to fill your website with content.
All Markdown files should be stored in one directory, for instance `docs/`.
You can use any text editor to create a Markdown file. Ensure the file extension is set to `.md`.

**Procedure:**

1. In the `docs/` directory, create an `index.md` file.
1. Edit the file and paste the following contents:

``` markdown
# Welcome

This is my first documentation website.
```
