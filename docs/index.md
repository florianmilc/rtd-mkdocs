# Welcome

The purpose of this humble website is to prove to all technical writers that building a documentation website is easy.
All sections included on this website are to tutor and assist you in creating your first website project from the scratch.
You will learn which tools you can use to configure a website, fill it with content, store it, and publish it.

Once you feel more comfortable, you can proceed to more advanced chapters (available soon!).
You will learn how to further customize the website so it pleases the eye and makes the users of your product(s) happy while informed.

If you are an experienced professional familiar with programming languages, but lack of resources, you can visit the [Related Information](related_info.md) section for a list of tools helpful in building a documentation website.

Peace. Love. Technical writing.

Technically yours,
<br>â€” *Florian*
