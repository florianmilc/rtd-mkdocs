# What's this all about?

This repository contains the result of my humble efforts to get acquinted with the procedures one has to perform to build a website.
Here I explain how to create a basic small website by using Read the Docs, MkDocs, and Markdown.
Additionally, as I advance in the subject, I plan to expand the website with procedures covering additional customization of the website.

You can clone the repository and run it locally or visit the website by clicking [here](https://rtd-mkdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Just a kind reminder, the website is and may remain in the "under construction" state for a quite a long time.
